   - Power Query is a data connectivity and preparation tool within Power BI. We used Power Query to clean, transform, and preprocess the dataset before analysis, ensuring data accuracy and consistency.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

During the initial stages of the project, we conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the pizza sales dataset. Here are some questions we explored:

- What were the total streams, tracks, and average streams On the platform?
- Which year has the highest stream released?
- Show the tracks & Streams by Months
- Which day recieved the most streams.
- Artist with the most streams and why?
